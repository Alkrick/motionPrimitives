# motionPrimitives

Library for implementations of different Motion Primitive Models

## ProMP
Work is based on [Probabilistic Motion Primitives Alexandros,et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258620153_Probabilistic_Movement_Primitives)

Can be used to produce a ProMP model of given trajectory samples, features include:
1. Training, saving and loading ProMP models.
2. Conditioning using Via Points.
3. Blending Motion Primitives.
4. Combining Motion Primitives.
